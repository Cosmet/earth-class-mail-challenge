## Data Presentation

Given access to the basic querying API, https://swapi.co/, can you create a user interface using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to read the API and display the data in an organized way?

The solution should include:

- A list view, with sorting functionality, that renders lists of each of entities.
- A detail view that renders more granular information about a specific entity.

The completed project must be delivered as a pull request on this repository and must be deployed & accessible via a public URL for in-browser testing.
